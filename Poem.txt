Are dogs really the best?
I thought that they were quite the feast
Even though dogs are somewhat of a beast
But I don't like them even the least
Cats are so much better
I could write a letter
About that gameplay that was meta
Dogs are not cute
They are quite the annoyance
Barking
Marking their territory

Honestly dunno what the hype is about
All people do is tout 
About their dogs
Just shut up
I don't care
Cats are better
At least they don't bark 
They're adorable
Cats are better
