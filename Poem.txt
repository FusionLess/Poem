Are dogs really the best?
I thought that they were quite the feast
Even though dogs are somewhat of a beast
But I don't like them even the least
Cats are so much better
I could write a letter
About that gameplay that was meta
Dogs are not cute
They are quite the annoyance
Barking
Marking their territory

Honestly dunno what the hype is about
All people do is tout 
About their dogs
Just shut up
I don't care
Cats are better
At least they don't bark 
They're adorable
Cats are better
=======
Cats aren't cool
They aren't the best
They look out the window a lot 
But sometimes they scratch your face
They purr to let you know they're happy!
Dogs are not like cats
dogs are the best
Their tails wag
Some dogs a floofy.
Floof is the best.
But dogs are big and they can scare children


But they are so cute and love pats
Frodo would have a cat but it would knock 
The one ring off the table

for fun.

I have a Vizsla at home. She is the best dog. A good dog.

Cats are sometimes cool
They are sometimes the best
They also have kittens
Kittens are small
